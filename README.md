# Tsai_et_al_CCR4_NOT_DRS_analysis
This repository includes the scripts used for Direct RNA sequencing analysis (both polyA tail length measurements and differential expression) of HeLa cells treated with arsenite/lipoamide. The reference genome used was hg38 (appended with the yeast ENO2 transcript sequence for the spike-in analysis). The NCBI Refseq hg38 annotation file was used for this anlaysis. Basecalling/alignment/polyA tail measurements were done with Dorado v0.9.0 (basecalling script ). All other packages used can be found in [here](basecalling_alignment_polyA/environment_DRS_env_packages.txt)
