# Tsai_et_al_CCR4NOT_DRS_analysis
This repository includes the scripts used for Direct RNA sequencing analysis (both polyA tail length measurements and differential expression) of HeLa cells treated with arsenite/lipoamide. The reference genome used was hg38 ([hg38.fa.gz](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/)). The yeast [ENO2 transcript sequence](https://useast.ensembl.org/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae/Gene/Sequence?db=core;g=YHR174W;r=VIII:451327-452640;t=YHR174W_mRNA) was appended to the reference genome for spike-in analysis. These scripts use the [NCBI Refseq hg38](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/genes/) annotation file. Basecalling/alignment/polyA tail measurements were done with [Dorado v0.9.0](basecalling_alignment_polyA/job_dorado_final.sh). All other packages used can be found [here](basecalling_alignment_polyA/environment_DRS_env_packages.txt). Main nanopore analysis pipeline can be found [here](basecalling_alignment_polyA/job_nanopore_polyA_pipeline_final_eno2.sh). Auxilliary scripts and files for the main pipeline can be found in the [basecalling_alignment_polyA](basecalling_alignment_polyA/) directory.
